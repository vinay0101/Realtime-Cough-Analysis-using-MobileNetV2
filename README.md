# Realtime-Cough-Analysis-using-MobileNetV2

I took inspiration of this project from the [paper][https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2021.580080/full]. This paper employs deep learning on mel spectrograms and helps in detecting patients with cough. I tried to make this process fast/real-time for practical purposes uses MobileNetV2 architecture. 

Dataset was taken from (here)[https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50].
